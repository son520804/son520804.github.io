				<h3><b>CALL FOR UX PROPOSALS</b></h3>
				<p>Welcome to the Call for Proposals/Registration page for the inaugural year of UX at UM.
					This is an interdisciplinary graduate-student led conference celebrating all that is User Experience (UX).
					If you are doing work in the area of UX, we would love to have you join us in Ann Arbor, Michigan for scholarly discussions related to UX.
					Because this is the first year of the conference, there is no theme other than UX.
					We invite any graduate student to submit to any and all of the following areas: panels, individual papers, roundtable discussions, and/or poster session.
					All submissions will be accepted as long as you are a graduate student and your work is in the area of UX.
					Fill the <a href="https://forms.gle/69eCaU6epg9LBn177">Call for Papers</a> form to submit proposals and papers to the 1st UX@UM conference.
