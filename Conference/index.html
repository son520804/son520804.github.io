			<p>While AI technologies are profoundly impacting society around the globe, the applications of AI are not immune to the risks of pitfalls of data-driven, AI-supported tools. I’m aware of and at the critical time to answer some research questions such as 1) How can we prepare K-12 students for an AI-permeated future? 2) How to enhance algorithmic fairness when predicting student’s learning outcome and behaviors? 3) How to arouse deeper dialogues among researchers working on AI-supported education and educational technology of the “Fairness, Accountability, Transparency and Ethics”, the FATE of AI around the ethical and societal implications of AI? The <a href="https://edtech.labs.si.umich.edu/">Educational Technology Collectives lab</a> I currently work with deeply engages with the concerns about the present and future roles of AI in education, that is the primary reason why I have always been grateful to work with professor Christopher Brooks and his research team!</p>
			<p>Music has always been my favorite pastime! Over 8 years, I love performing and composing music, so this is <a href="/about/Music">my page</a> about some musical performances I attended. Recently inspired by the rising significance of music information retrieval, I started to extract features from polyphonic music and wrote <a href="/Teaching/Visualization/Music_Processing_using_Spectrogram.html">tutorials</a> for the Master’s of Applied Data Science program. I continue to spend time composing a cappella music, instrumental music and involving in audio editing every week. If you love music composition or music information retrieval, please do not feel hesitant to reach out me at insonz@umich.edu.</p>
