			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am In Son Zeng. I am from Macau. Macau is a lovely and historical place with only about 20 square miles. I studied applied Mathematics, with a specialization in mathematical modeling and statistics modeling at the University of Macau.</p>
			<p>During my undergrad, I participated in various competitions, including COMAP 2017, CUMCM 2016 and datathon contests. I also love performing and composing music, so this is my page about some music that I made.</p>
			<p>I pursued master's program of Applied Statistics at the University of Michigan, a university of much relevance to my academic growth! I started to develop genuene passion to Bayesian Statistics.</p>
			<p>I also taught STATS 412 and recorded videos for instructional support.
