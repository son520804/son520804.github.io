			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am In Son Zeng. I am from Macau, a lovely and historical place with area as small as about 20 square miles. During my undergraduate study, I majored in Mathematics, with a specialization in mathematical modeling and statistics modeling at the University of Macau.</p>
			<p>My interests in interdisciplinary studies sparked my passion to participate in various international contests for mathematical modeling, including COMAP 2017 (<a href="">Awarded Agent-based Modelling Paper</a>), CUMCM 2016 and datathon contests.</p>
			<p>I pursued master's program of Applied Statistics at the University of Michigan, a university of much relevance to my academic growth! I started to develop genuene passion to Bayesian Statistics, Educational Statistics, and Machine Learning. In the realm of education, I was thrilled in how to design course materials, record time-coded live coding demonstrations and produce inspirational MOOCs in Coursera such as the Applied Data Science in Python series. This is exactly the primary reason why I have always dreamed to work with professor Christopher Brooks and his research team!</p>
			<p>I also taught STATS 412 and recorded videos for instructional support. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ShMzFyInW0&t=11s">Regression 1</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H66cNRQVZk&t=2s">Regression 2</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSZbqHQQhIo&t=5s">Regression 3</a><p>
			<p>A passionate, caring and diligent person with genuine love to statistics. That is who I am.</p>
			<p>I also love performing and composing music, so this is <a href="/about/Music">my page</a> about some music that I made.</p>
