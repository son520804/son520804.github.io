				<p><strong>Character-by-character Comments</strong></p>
				<p>Traditionally, live coding videos are presented by screen sharing. As instructors write code in the IDE (i.e. Jupyter notebook), an open-source web application for interactive programming, they can synchronise real-time narration to explain how the code works. However, most instructors find it difficult to simultaneously type and annotate the code while clearly explaining the code logic under the hood. Moreover, most instructors failed to verbally explain how code works temporally contiguous with the code demonstration. To address both issues, I was motivated to design character-by-character comments when recording lecture videos, a technique invented by Educational Technology Collectives at the University of Michigan, to reproduce every character of Python codes and comments according to the timestamp instructor’s auditory explanation is played. By implementing the character-by-character comments on live coding videos, I invoked dual-coding effect and reduced split-attention effect, which requires lower cognitive load for students to navigate and leads to higher learning satisfaction and learning gain.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Main Study</strong></p>
				<p>I constructed an <a href="">experiment</a> that involves three different playback speed options and three commonly used video design conditions including different comment design and with or without instructor’s face showing up on the screen. The main objective of the experiment drills into how educational quality of video is influenced by playback speed and video design. Particularly, the project questions if a small increase in lecture speed can induce time saving and boost engagement while not sacrificing learning outcome, and if the presence of the instructor makes classes more engaging to students.</p>
