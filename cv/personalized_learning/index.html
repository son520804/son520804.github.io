		<p>In traditional classrooms, all students are expected to learn material at the same time and in the same way. Many find themselves either ahead or behind others, and learning outcomes suffer, particularly for those who need extra time to master the material.
In order for a large population of learners to seamlessly acquire new knowledge, they need a learning experience that is tailored to their unique skills, needs and interests. Such experience can broadly be called <b>personalized learning</b>.</p>
		<p>Personalized learning is instructional approach that empowers students to learn by the method, and at the pace, that best suits their needs. Unlike active learning or blended learning, which are more prescriptive, personalized learning sees educators tailor the course experience according to specific student needs.Flipped courses, competency-based education, and online classes are inspired by future education needs to create flexible, personalized learning opportunities for each student.
Research from learning at scale shows huge improvement in learning outcomes, student confidence, student accountability, student retention and ultimately, degree completion by adopting personalized learning environment.</p>
