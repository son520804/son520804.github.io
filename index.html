					<h1>InSon Zeng - Intelligence, <br>Self-regulation, Zeal</h1>
					<br>
					<p>I am In Son! I am a researcher who loves to explore learning at scale and learnersourcing in asynchronous learning environment. I had a background in statistics and mathematic education, which shaped my research direction to focus on creating personalized contents and messages in online educational platforms to engage learners.</p>

					<h2>Why learning at scale?</h2>
					<p>Because <b>I care about the quality and accessibility of education</b> throughout the world. Starting to teach students at the age of 13 enabled me to see the need of scalable student support assisted by artificial intelligence, which
		sparked my passion in designing solutions and creating personalized learning experiences.
		</p>
				</div>

				<div class="right-content">
					<h2>Why does personalized learning experience matter?</h2>
					<p>As the use of computer is growing in popularity, I started to see a decrease in student engagement in traditional classes. I realized a shift from teacher-centered to a student-centered pedagogy is necessary to enhance students' learning experience and study outcomes. The vision of <b>transforming one-size-fit-all school curriculums with personalized curriculums</b> which highlight individual skill sets within learners has drawn growing attention among researchers and practitioners.</p>

					<h2>What are some of my research hypotheses about learning analytics?</h2>
					<p style="font-weight:500;margin-bottom:10px;">First, for MOOC online courses, learning gain is higher</p>
					<ol class="c">
						<li> with spatially contiguous verbal message than with video subtitles (because of the lower cognitive load)</li>
						<li> using keywords than with verbatim explanation </li>
						<li> by watching accelerated video speed (e.g. 1.25x, 1.5x) over the original speed</li>
						<li> with content-heavy learning than content-free learning</li>
					</ol>

				<div class="middle-content">
					<p style="font-weight:500;margin-bottom:10px;">For MOOC online courses, learners prefer</p>
					<ol class="c">
						<li> spatially contiguous verbal comments over video subtitles (because comments locate more closely to the learning material such as codes)</li>
						<li> spatially contiguous verbal comments over slides (because all comments are time-coded, unlike there are extraneous contents in slides)</li>
						<li> accelerated video speed (e.g. 1.25x, 1.5x) over the original speed</li>
						<li> viewing instructorâ€™s face in lectures over screen share only lectures</li>
						<li> background music interspersed with lecture sections (use signposting to reduce cognitive load)</li>

					<h2>What are my vocational hobbies?</h2>
					<p>Music has always been my favorite pastime. I spent 8 years on self-teaching my music composition and tuning capabilities. Recently I am emphatic about <b>music information retrieval methods</b> and experimenting how music can be leveraged as a psycho-social intervention in <b>cognitive behavioural therapy</b>.</p>
