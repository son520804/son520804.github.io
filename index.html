		<h1>Hi I'm In Son Zeng from University of Michigan!</h1>
		<p>Welcome to In Son's homepage! I'm best known as a passionate, patient and loving instructor and tutor. 
			My research interests are Agent-based modeling, educational statistics, Bayesian modeling and Stochastic Processes.
			Since my work is technical, I spend most of my time off from work on cooking, composing music and reading classical literature. Work-life balance is important in driving me to move forward!
			Have a fun experience watching my professional and life experiences!
