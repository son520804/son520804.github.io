			<h1>InSon Zeng - Intelligence, Self-regulation, Zeal</h1>
			<p>I am In Son! I am a researcher who loves to explore learning at scale and learnersourcing in asynchronous learning environment. I had a background in statistics and mathematic education, which shaped my research direction to focus on creating personalized contents and messages in online educational platforms to engage learners.</p>

			<br><h2>Why learning at scale?</h2>
			<p>Because I care about the quality and accessibility of education throughout the world. Starting to teach students at the age of 13 enabled me to see the need of scalable student support assisted by artificial intelligence, which
sparked my passion in designing solutions and creating personalized learning experiences.  
</p>

			<br><h2>Why does personalized learning experience matter?</h2>
			<p>As the use of computer is growing in popularity, I started to see a decrease in student engagement in traditional classes. I realized a shift from teacher-centered to a student-centered pedagogy is necessary to enhance students' learning experience and study outcomes. The vision of transforming one-size-fit-all school curriculums with personalized curriculums which highlight individual skill sets within learners has drawn growing attention among researchers and practitioners. During one of my research at the University of Michigan - Educational Technology Collectives, I read the paper <b>AXIS: Generating Explanations at Scale with Learnersourcing and Machine Learning</b> written by Joseph et al. I came to realize that in the future, personalized learning aided by learnersourcing and machine learning will provide a transformative, more efficient learning experience to large populations of remote learners.</p>
