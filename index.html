			<h1>InSon Zeng - Intelligence, Self-regulation, Zeal</h1>
			<p>I am In Son! I am a researcher who loves to explore learning at scale and learnersourcing in asynchronous learning environment. I had a background in statistics and mathematic education, which shaped my research direction to focus on creating personalized contents and messages in online educational platforms to engage learners.</p>

			<br><h2>Why learning at scale?</h2>
			<p>Because <b>I care about the quality and accessibility of education</b> throughout the world. Starting to teach students at the age of 13 enabled me to see the need of scalable student support assisted by artificial intelligence, which
sparked my passion in designing solutions and creating personalized learning experiences.
</p>


			<br><h2>Why does personalized learning experience matter?</h2>
			<p>As the use of computer is growing in popularity, I started to see a decrease in student engagement in traditional classes. I realized a shift from teacher-centered to a student-centered pedagogy is necessary to enhance students' learning experience and study outcomes. The vision of <b>transforming one-size-fit-all school curriculums with personalized curriculums</b> which highlight individual skill sets within learners has drawn growing attention among researchers and practitioners. During one of my research at the University of Michigan - Educational Technology Collectives, I read the paper <b>AXIS: Generating Explanations at Scale with Learnersourcing and Machine Learning</b> written by Joseph et al. I came to realize that in the future, personalized learning aided by learnersourcing and machine learning will provide a transformative, more efficient learning experience to large populations of remote learners.</p>

			<br><h2>What are some of my hypotheses regarding the learning process and outcome?</h2>
			<ol class="c">
				<li>For MOOC online courses, learning gain is 1) higher with spatially contiguous verbal message than with video subtitles (because of the lower cognitive load), and 2) higher using keywords than with verbatim explanation, 3) accelerated video speed (e.g. 1.25x, 1.5x) over the original speed</li>
			  <li>For MOOC online courses, learners prefer 1) spatially contiguous verbal comments over video subtitles (because comments locate more closely to the learning material such as codes), 2) spatially contiguous verbal comments over slides (because all comments are time-coded, unlike there are extraneous contents in slides), 3) accelerated video speed (e.g. 1.25x, 1.5x) over the original speed, 4) viewing instructorâ€™s face in lectures over screen share only lectures, 5) background music interspersed with lecture sections (use signposting to reduce cognitive load)</li>
			  <li>Learners generally mind-wander less with 1) spatially contiguous verbal comments over video subtitle (because comments locate more closely to the learning material such as codes), 2) spatially contiguous verbal comments over presentation slides (because all comments are time-coded, unlike there are extraneous contents in slides), 3) accelerated video speed (e.g. 1.25x, 1.5x) over the original speed</li>

			<br><h2>What are my vocational hobbies?</h2>
			<p>Music has always been my favorite pastime. I spent 8 years on self-teaching my music composition and tuning capabilities. Recently I am emphatic about <b>music information retrieval methods</b> and experimenting how music can be leveraged as a psycho-social intervention in <b>cognitive behavioural therapy</b>.</p>
